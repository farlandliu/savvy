When updating a new post, we need Vercel to auto deploy the new commit from github.

## Create a Vercel deploy hook

1. make sure the project is connected to github repo.
2. Once the project is live, go to the `Settings page` > `GIt` menu.
3. In the `Deploy Hooks` section, give a hook name and select the branch.

   and activate the webook.
